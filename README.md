# m2022figures

This repository provides some working examples of producing figures with GrIMP packages, but the are not tutorial in nature. More in depth tutorials are located [here](https://github.com/fastice/GrIMPTools)

## Binder

These notebooks can all be run in the cloud by using the binder links below. 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fastice/m2022figures/HEAD?urlpath=lab) (potentially faster)

[![Binder](https://gesis.mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://gesis.mybinder.org/v2/gh/fastice/m2022figures/HEAD?urlpath=lab) (more memory)

Note Figures 1 & 2 must download several hundred files, which takes tens of minutes. Binder will time out if not in the foreground. The other notebooks run in a few minutes or less.
